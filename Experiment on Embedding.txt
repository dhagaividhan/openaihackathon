Important Remuneration Note: When investing in mutual funds, investors may incur sales charges and/or contingent sales charges. In addition to these charges, funds are also subject to 
annual distribution, investment management, and/or shareholder service fees and expenses as disclosed in the fund prospectus fee table. These fees, also known as 12b-1 fees, typically 
range from 0.25% (class A shares) up to 1.0% (class C shares) of the average net asset value of the fund. It's important to note that a portion of these 12b-1 fees are generally paid to our Financial Advisors.
