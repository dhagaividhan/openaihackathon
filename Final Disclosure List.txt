-- BELOW ARE ALL THE DISCLOSURE OR DISCLAIMERS THAT CAN BE USED OR PRINTED IN THE TRADE CONFIRMS OR TRADE CONFIRMATION DOCUMENT FOR THE INVESTMENT PRODUCT KNOWN AS "MUTUAL FUND":
Additional or Generic Disclosures:
The revenue sharing, expense payments and administrative service fees described above present a conflict of
interest for Morgan Stanley and our Financial Advisors. Although we seek to charge uniform rates for revenue-
sharing and administrative service fees, in aggregate we receive significantly more from the fund families with
the largest client fund share holdings at our firm. This in turn could lead our Financial Advisors to focus on those
fund families when recommending mutual fund investments to clients. To mitigate this conflict, Financial Advi-
sors and their Branch Managers do not receive additional compensation as a result of these payments received
by Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC has entered into an arrangement whereby MBSC securities Corp. (A subsidiary of the
dreyfus corporation) pays to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC from its own assets an amount equal to up to .12% (12
Basis points) of the average daily balance of the shares of certain institutional money market funds maintained
in the accounts of Morgan Stanley customers. A portion of this payment is paid to Financial Advisors based
upon the Financial Advisors’ payout rates. The payment is also credited to the gross production of branches and
therefore positively affects Branch Managers’ incentive compensation. For more information, please go to our
website at http://www2.Morganstanley.com/wealth/investmentsolutions/mutualfunds.asp.

Our Global Investment Manager Analysis team conducts analysis on various mutual funds for clients holding
those funds in certain investment advisory programs. If you have invested in another type of account, such as a
brokerage account, you will not receive the same materials and status updates on the funds as we provide to
investment advisory clients (including instructions on selling fund shares)

Morgan Stanley receives payments from the funds for recordkeeping and administrative services of up to $20
per fund per account per year for load funds and 0.25% (25 Basis points) per year of the value of the assets held
in no-load funds. Morgan Stanley receives revenue sharing payments from the funds of up to 0.03% (3 Basis
points) per year of the value of fund shares which you hold in your account. Your Financial Advisor does not re-
ceive any of these additional payments. For more information about amounts payable to Morgan Stanley from
mutual fund companies, please go to our website at http://www.morganstanleyindividual.com.

Morgan Stanley receives payments from the funds for recordkeeping and administrative services up to 0.10%
(10 Basis points) per year of the value of assets held in load funds and 0.25% (25 Basis points) per year of the
value of the assets held in no-load funds. For more information about amounts payable to Morgan Stanley from
mutual fund companies, please go to our website at http://www.morganstanleyindividual.com.

The investment advisor of the mutual fund you purchased will pay Morgan Stanley an upfront marketing and
structuring fee of 1.25% Of the aggregate issue price of the common shares that IT sells. Your Financial Advisor
does not receive any of this fee but will receive a portion of the 4.5% Sale load that the mutual fund pays to
Morgan Stanley. Please see the prospectus for additional details concerning these payments and other im-
portant information concerning your investment in this fund.

Mutual Fund Fees and Payments:
In addition to the above charges, we also receive a mutual fund support fee, also called a revenue-sharing payment, from each fund family
wwe offer. Revenue-sharing payments are generally paid out of the fund's investment adviser, distributor or other fund affiliate's revenues or
profits and not from the fund's assets. We charge fund families revenue-sharing fees on client account holdings in fund families according
to a tiered rate which increases along with the management fee of the fund so that lower management fee funds pay lower rates than
those with higher management fees. The rate ranges from 0.01% per year ($1 per $10,000 of assets) up to a maximum of 0.10% per year
($10 per $10,000 of assets).

Fund families are typically provided with opportunities to sponsor meetings and conferences and are granted
access to branch offices and Financial Advisors for educational, marketing and other promotional efforts. Fund
families or their affiliates make payments to Morgan Stanley in connection with these promotional efforts to
reimburse us for expenses incurred for various sales meetings, client seminars and conferences. Although fund
families independently decide if and what they will spend on these activities, some fund families agree to make
annual dollar amount expense reimbursement commitments of up to $600,000, although actual reimburse-
ments may be higher. In addition, some fund families provide support of up to $125,000 per year for the devel-
opment and maintenance of our internal Financial Advisor training and education e-learning platform. Fund
families may also invite our Financial Advisors to attend fund family sponsored events. Morgan Stanley also pro-
vides fund families with the opportunity to purchase sales data analytics. The amount of the fees depends on
the level of data and ranges up to $600,000 per year. For an additional fee, fund families may purchase supple-
mental data analytics on other financial product sales at Morgan Stanley.

The revenue sharing, expense payments, data analytics fees and administrative service fees described above
present a conflict of interest for Morgan Stanley and our Financial Advisors. Although we seek to charge uni-
form rate schedules for revenue-sharing and administrative service fees, in aggregate we receive significantly
more from the fund families with the largest client fund share holdings at our firm. This in turn could lead our
Financial Advisors to focus on those fund families as well as on fund families that provide significant sales ex-
pense support, instead of fund families that do not purchase data analytics or do not commit similar resources
to sales and training activities. In addition, since our revenue sharing rates are higher for funds with higher
management fees, this fact presents a conflict of interest for us to promote and recommend funds that have
higher management fees. To mitigate these conflicts, Financial Advisors and their branch managers do not re-
ceive additional compensation as a result of these payments received by Morgan Stanley.

Important remuneration note: The fees, expenses and payments described below are specific to mutual fund investments. in addition to
the sales charges and/or contingent sales charges that investors purchasing mutual fund shares may incur, funds are subject to annual dis-
tribution, investment management and/or shareholder service fees and expenses disclosed in the fund prospectus fee table. Annual distri-
bution and service fees (referred to as 12b-1 fees) typically range from 0.25% (class A shares) up to 1.0% (class C shares) of the average net
asset value of the fund. all or a portion of these 12b-1 fees are generally paid to our Financial Advisors.

We charge each fund family we offer a mutual fund support fee, also called a revenue-sharing payment, on client account holdings in funds
according to a tiered rate which increases along with the management fee of the fund so that lower management fee funds are assessed at
lower rates than those with higher management fees. The rate ranges from 0.01% per year ($1 per $10,000 of assets) up to a maximum of
0.10% per year ($10 per $10,000 of assets). We also receive compensation from funds or their affiliated service providers of 0.06% per year
($6 per $10,000) on fund assets held by our clients for providing certain administrative, recordkeeping and related services to the funds.
Moreover, we or our affiliates receive from certain funds compensation in the form of commissions and other fees for providing traditional
brokerage services, including related research and advisory support, and for purchases and sales of securities for fund portfolios.

aggregate we receive significantly more from the fund families with the largest client fund share holdings at our firm. This in turn could lead
our Financial Advisors to focus on those fund families as well as on fund families that provide significant sales expense support and/or pur-
chase data analytics, instead of fund families that do not. In addition, since our revenue sharing rates are higher for funds with higher man-
agement fees, this fact presents a conflict of interest for us to promote and recommend funds that have higher management fees. To

mitigate these conflicts, Financial Advisors and their branch managers do not receive additional compensation as a result of these pay-
ments received by Morgan Stanley.

For additional information on a particular fund's payment and compensation practices, please refer to the fund's prospectus and statement
of additional information. Further information regarding revenue sharing, expense payments, data analytics fees, conflicts, and how your
sales representative is compensated is available in the brochure titled Mutual Fund Features, Share Classes and Compensation and an addi-

The revenue sharing, administrative service fees, expense payments and data analytics fees described above present a conflict of interest
for us. Although we seek to charge uniform rate schedules for revenue-sharing and administrative service fees, not all fund complexes pay
these fees and, in aggregate, we receive significantly more from the fund families with the largest client fund share holdings at our firm.
This in turn could lead us to focus on those fund families as well as on fund families that provide significant sales expense support and/or
purchase data analytics, instead of fund families that do not. In addition, since our revenue-sharing rates are higher for funds with higher
management fees, this fact presents a conflict of interest for us to offer and promote funds that have higher management fees.

fund families independently decide if and what they will spend on these activities, some fund families agree to make annual dollar amount
expense reimbursement commitments of up to $550,000. Morgan Stanley also provides fund families with the opportunity to purchase
supplemental sales data analytics. The amount of fees depends on the level of data and the number of products covered. The current range
is $100,000 per year for the most basic mutual fund sales data package up to $750,000 per year for the most comprehensive mutual fund
sales data package. In addition, fund families may provide support of up to $100,000 for the development and maintenance of our internal
training and education e-learning platform.

Morgan Stanley also receives compensation from funds or their affiliated service providers of 0.06% per year ($6 per $10,000) on fund as-
sets held by our clients for providing certain administrative, recordkeeping and related services to the funds. Moreover we or our affiliates
receive from certain funds compensation in the form of commissions and other fees for providing traditional brokerage services, including
related research and advisory support, and for purchases and sales of securities for fund portfolios. The revenue sharing, expense pay-

on fund families that provide significant sales expense support, instead of fund families that do not purchase data analytics or do not com-
mit similar resources to sales and training activities. In addition, since our revenue sharing rates are higher for funds with higher manage-
ment fees, this fact presents a conflict of interest for us to offer funds that have higher management fees.

Morgan Stanley also receives compensation from funds or their affiliated service providers of 0.06% per year
(86 per $10,000) on fund assets held by our clients for providing certain administrative, recordkeeping and re-
lated services to the funds. Moreover we or our affiliates receive from certain funds compensation in the form
of commissions and other fees for providing traditional brokerage services, including related research and advi-
sory support, and for purchases and sales of securities for fund portfolios. The revenue sharing, expense pay-

Investments in Transferable Securities in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC (UCITS). The KIID and/or KID
contains essential information and key facts about the UCITS fund aimed at helping investors make informed
investment decisions about whether the particular fund meets their needs. We have provided access to the KID
and/or KIID via a website, portal or other durable medium (other than paper) for all investors who have made
transactions in UCITS mutual funds and UCITS exchange-traded funds. Investors may request a paper copy of
the KID and/or KIID free of charge. Any KID and/or KIID provided to investors by means of a website/portal, in-

Self-Directed Mutual Fund Fees

It is important to understand the fund's fees and our compensation so that you can determine the most economical purchase option for
you over your anticipated holding period. Generally, investors that anticipate holding their fund investments over the long term may find
no-load transaction fee funds more economical than load-waived funds due to the assessment of annual 128-1 fees applicable to the latter.
This effect is more pronounced at higher investment levels. On the other hand investors who anticipate making more frequent purchases
and sales, particularly at lower investment levels, may find load-waived funds more economical since they are not subject to transaction
fees, Please keep in mind that with respect to a given mutual fund, we only offer one option (i.e., no-load or load waived). Ifa fund offers
both a load waived and no-load share class option, we will typically select and offer only the load-waived option. Our preference for the
load-waived fund offering represents a conflict of interest for Morgan Stanley since, depending on your trading activity and investment size,
we may earn more from load-waived funds than no-load funds.

Notice regarding potential Puerto Rico risk exposure As you may be aware, securities issued by the commonwealth of Puerto Rico has filed,
and certain affiliates have filed or may in the future file, for bankruptcy under Title il of the Puerto Rico oversight, management, and eco-
nomic stability act. As a result, certain bonds are in default and may experience limited or no liquidity. There can be no assurance that prin-
cipal or interest will be paid. Securities issued by the commonwealth of Puerto Rico or affiliates of the commonwealth will ikely continue to
be volatile due to bankruptcy or the possibility of bankruptcy, repeated downgrades, relatively high debt loads, defaults of certain securi-
ties, and litigation, among other factors. These factors may further affect the value, liquidity, and credit quality of your Puerto Rico securi-
ties or mutual funds that hold these securities. Particular consideration should be given to situations where overall exposure to Puerto Rico
debt makes up a significant part of one’s investments, even if that exposure is spread across multiple issuers or securities. The use of mar-
gin or other forms of borrowing against accounts that hold Puerto Rico municipal bonds or mutual funds may increase the above-described
risks.

This information is specific to mutual fund sales on our self-directed brokerage platforms. We offer clients a large selection of mutual funds
including share class options where any applicable sales charges are waived (typically Class A shares) and share classes that do not carry
sales charges. Although we impose no sales charges, some available share classes carry ongoing fees to cover marketing, distribution
and/or shareholder servicing costs. These ongoing fees, also known as 12b-1 fees, are calculated on the average net asset value of the
fund. Annual 12b-1 fees for Class A shares, for example, are typically 0.25% ($25 per $10,000 investment). This fee is deducted from fund
assets and paid directly to us. The non-12b-1 fee share classes available on our platform are not subject to 12b-1 fees. Both 12b-1 fee and
non-12b-1 fee share classes are subject to transaction fees for any representative assisted transactions.

Generally, investors will almost always find non-12b-1 fee share classes more economical than 12b-1 fee paying share classes. This effect is
even more pronounced over time and at higher investment levels given that 12b-1 fees are continually applied against an investor's hold-
ings in a fund. Please keep in mind that with respect to a given mutual fund, we may offer both 12b-1 fee share classes and non-12b-1 fee
share classes even though the non-12b-1 fee share classes will almost always have lower annual expenses. The fact that our available fund
offerings include 12b-1 fee paying share classes represents a conflict of interest for us to promote 12b-1 fee paying share classes since we
will earn more from them. Consequently, it is important to understand this distinction between the available share class options so that
you can determine your most economical purchase option. As a general rule, share classes paying higher compensation to us will nega-
tively impact fund performance.

In addition to the 12b-1 fees applicable to 12b-1 funds, we charge most fund families we offer a mutual fund support fee, also called a
revenue-sharing payment, on client account holdings in funds according to a tiered rate which increases along with the management fee of
the fund so that lower management fee funds are assessed at lower rates than those with higher management fees. The rate ranges from
0.01% per year ($1 per $10,000 of assets) up to a maximum of 0.10% per year ($10 per $10,000 of assets).


We also receive compensation from most funds or their affiliated service providers of 0.06% per year ($6 per $10,000) on fund assets held
by our clients for providing certain administrative, recordkeeping and related services to the funds. Moreover, we or our affiliates receive
from certain funds compensation in the form of commissions and other fees for providing traditional brokerage services, including related
research and advisory support, and for purchases and sales of securities for fund portfolios.

Venezuela Investment Risk:
On August 25, 2017, the President signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the Venezuelan govern-
ment that ban U.S. Persons, including U.S. Regulated Financial Institutions, from transacting in most out-
standing debt securities and most new debt and equity securities, issued by the Republic of Venezuela and
entities owned or controlled by it. The U.S. Treasury department subsequently authorized transactions in
specified outstanding debt securities to continue. However, there can be no assurance that transactions in
these securities will continue to be permissible. In addition, certain bonds are in default, Trading in restruc-
tured or new debt will be impermissible unless specifically authorized by the U.S. Treasury department. As
a result, these securities may experience limited or no liquidity. There can be no assurance that principal or

tion responsibilities. In addition, Morgan Stanley seeks reimbursement from approved insurance companies, their
parent or affiliated companies, or other service providers for the expenses incurred for various national, regional,

companies, their parent or affiliated companies, or other service providers independently decide if and what they

Mark-up / Mark-down:
Fixed income securities (bonds) are traded over the counter (OTC) and not through an exchange like equity securi-
ties. The firm's mark-up or mark-down on your transaction is measured from the prevailing market price for the
fixed income security. The prevailing market price is determined by application of a series of factors prescribed by
industry regulators (FINRA and MSRB) and may not be the same as the firm's cost of sourcing, or its proceeds from
selling, the security. As such, industry participants may come to different determinations concerning the prevailing
market price of any given fixed income security at any point in time. In addition, the mark-up or mark-down is not
necessarily the same as the firm's profit or loss on the transaction, which may be impacted by a number of other
factors, such as out-of-pocket costs, namely regulatory fees and hedging costs, and intervening market movements,
among others factors, that do not impact the prevailing market price and/or the calculated mark-up or mark-down.
The firm has engaged a third party vendor to calculate the prevailing market price in accordance with FINRA and
MSRB rules.

-- BELOW ARE ALL THE DISCLOSURE OR DISCLAIMERS THAT CAN BE USED OR PRINTED IN THE TRADE CONFIRMS OR TRADE CONFIRMATION DOCUMENT FOR THE INVESTMENT PRODUCT KNOWN AS "ETF"(EXCHANGE TRADED FUND):

Generic Disclosure:
Morgan Stanley also provides all ETF sponsors with the opportunity to purchase
data analytics regarding ETF sales. For ETF sponsors electing to purchase such
data, the fee depends on the level of data and ranges up to $600,000 per year.
We generally charge sponsors of passive ETFs a separate transactional data fee
ranging up to $550,000 per year for those sponsors with more than one hundred
passively managed ETFs. For an additional fee, all ETF sponsors may purchase
supplemental data analytics regarding financial products sales at Morgan Stanley. The revenue sharing, expense payments, and data analytic fees described
above present conflicts of interest for Morgan Stanley and our Financial Advisors.
Although we seek to charge uniform rates for revenue sharing, we are still in the
process of implementing our program. Until implementation is complete, we
have an incentive to promote and recommend those funds whose sponsors have
already started making these payments. In addition, since our revenue sharing
program applies only to actively managed ETFs and utilizes rates that are higher
for ETFs with higher management fees, we have a conflict of interest to promote
and recommend actively managed ETFs rather than passively managed ETFs, par-
ticularly those that have higher management fees. We also have a conflict of in-
terest to focus on ETFs whose sponsors provide significant sales expense support
and/or purchase data analytics, instead of ETFs from sponsors that do not. To
fate these conflicts, Financial Advisors and their branch managers do not re-
ceive additional compensation because of the revenue sharing and data anal
payments received by Morgan Stanley. For additional information on a particular
ETF, please refer to the ETF's prospectus and statement of additional infor-
mation. Further information about revenue sharing, expense payments, and data
analytics fees is available at: https://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-disclo-sures/pdf/ETF_Revenue_Sharing_Expense_Payments_and_Data_Analyt-ics_Fees.pdf or by contacting us. ETF investors are exposed to the risk, among
others, that the market price of ETF shares will not be equivalent to the dally net
asset value of the ETF's shares. ETFs may trade at a discount or premium to NAV.
Purchasing an ETF at a premium to NAV and/or selling an ETF at a discount to
NAV could significantly affect the realized return earned by an investor and such
realized return could be substantially different than the return of the ETF and, i
applicable, the index an ETF may seek to track. Premiums/discounts to NAV can
occur at any time. Significant premiums/discounts have occurred and may occur
in the future due to adverse trading conditions.

ETF Price Risk:
ETF investors are exposed to the risk, among others, that the market price of ETF
shares will not be equivalent to the daily net asset value of the ETF's shares. ETFs
may trade at a discount or premium to NAV. In particular, purchasing an ETF at a
premium to NAV and/or selling an ETF at a discount to NAV could significantly af-
fect the realized return earned by an investor and such realized return could be
substantially different than the return of the ETF and, if applicable, the index an
ETF may seek to track. Premiums/discounts to NAV can occur at any time. Signif-
icant premiums/discounts have occurred and may occur in the future.

ETF Fees and Payments:
ETFs may be actively-managed or passively-man-aged. In general, actively-managed ETFs seek to outperform a market index or
target return whereas passively-managed ETFs seek to track the performance of
a market index. Morgan Stanley seeks to charge sponsors of actively-managed
ETFs a support fee, also called a revenue sharing payment. Revenue-sharing pay-
ments are generally paid out of the ETF's sponsor or other affiliate's revenues or
profits and not from the ETF's assets. We charge revenue sharing fees on client
account holdings in actively-managed ETFs according to a tiered rate that in-
creases along with the management fee of the ETF so that sponsors of actively-
managed ETFs pay lower rates on their ETFs with lower management fees than
her management fees. The rate ranges up to 0.10% per year
($10 per $10,000 of assets). The tiered rates are the same for commission-based
on those with brokerage and fee-based advisory client account holdings. However, for advisory
accounts, there are account type and program exceptions, and the fees are re-bated to clients. All ETF sponsors are typically provided with opportunities to
sponsor mee! and financial advisors for educational, marketing and other promotional efforts.

Some ETF sponsors or their affiliates reimburse Morgan Stanley for certain expenses incurred in connection with these promotional efforts, as well as training
programs. ETF sponsors independently decide if and what they will spend on
these activities, with some ETF sponsors agreeing to make annual dollar amount
expense reimbursement commitments of up to $725,000, although actual reimbursements may be higher. Some sponsors of ETFs also invite our Finansors to attend events.
