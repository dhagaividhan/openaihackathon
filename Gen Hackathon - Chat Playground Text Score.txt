Below are two texts and I want you to give me the similarity score:

Text 1:
1. Regulatory disclaimer: The confirmation statement should include a disclaimer stating that the investment is subject to regulatory guidelines and requirements, and the transaction has been executed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 2. Mutual Fund disclosure: The confirmation should clearly state that the investment is in a mutual fund and provide the full name of the fund, in this case, 3. Investment objective and risk disclosure: The confirmation should provide a brief description of the mutual fund's investment objective and disclose the associated risks. This may include information about the volatility, market risks, and potential loss of principal associated with investing in small-cap funds. 4. Performance disclosure: The confirmation should disclose that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and that the investment value can fluctuate. 5. Legal and tax implications: The confirmation statement should state that clients should seek legal and tax advice regarding the investment, as the purchase of mutual fund units may have legal and tax implications based on the investor's unique circumstances. 6. Fees and expenses: The confirmation should clearly disclose any fees, expenses, or charges associated

Text 2:

A:
The semantic similarity between Text 1 and Text 2 is relatively low. Although both texts mention mutual funds and contain some common financial terminology, they focus on different aspects. Text 1 discusses regulatory disclaimers, investment objectives, risks, performance disclosure, legal and tax implications, fees, and expenses. Text 2, on the other hand, talks about advisory account conversion, share class holdings, expense ratios, and advisory client agreement. While there is some financial overlap, the specific context and information in each text are distinct.
