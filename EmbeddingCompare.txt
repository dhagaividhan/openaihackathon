disc2="""Mark-up / Mark-down: Fixed income securities (bonds) are traded over the counter (OTC) and not through an exchange like equity securi- ties. The firm's mark-up or mark-down on your transaction is measured from the prevailing market price for the fixed income security. The prevailing market price is determined by application of a series of factors prescribed by industry regulators (FINRA and MSRB) and may not be the same as the firm's cost of sourcing, or its proceeds from selling, the security. As such, industry participants may come to different determinations concerning the prevailing market price of any given fixed income security at any point in time. In addition, the mark-up or mark-down is not necessarily the same as the firm's profit or loss on the transaction, which may be impacted by a number of other factors, such as out-of-pocket costs, namely regulatory fees and hedging costs, and intervening market movements, among others factors, that do not impact the prevailing market price and/or the calculated mark-up or mark-down. The firm has engaged a third party vendor to calculate the prevailing market price in accordance with FINRA and MSRB rules."""
